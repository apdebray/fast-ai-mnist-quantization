# MNIST CNN Classifier (PyTorch)

This notebook demonstrates my first convolutional neural network using PyTorch, trained on the MNIST dataset. It achieves over **99% test accuracy** after applying model improvements like dropout, normalization, and Adam optimization.

This is part of my learning journey toward the USAF/MIT Phantom Program's **Fast AI track**.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- PyTorch data loaders
- CNN architecture for image classification
- Model training and evaluation on GPU
- Adam optimizer and loss tracking
- Input normalization
- Dropout for regularization

## 📁 File
- `Pytorch_Demo1.ipynb` – Full training notebook with results

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Quantize and export the model (ONNX)
- Deploy to edge device (Jetson / OpenVINO)
- Stream inference via Kafka pipeline
